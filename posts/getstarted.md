This RFC (Request for Comment) outlines the biggest update to Next.js since it was introduced in 2016:

Nested Layouts: Build complex applications with nested routes.
Designed for Server Components: Optimized for subtree navigation.
Improved Data Fetching: Fetch in layouts while avoiding waterfalls.
Using React 18 Features: Streaming, Transitions, and Suspense.
Client and Server Routing: Server-centric routing with SPA-like behavior.
100% incrementally adoptable: No breaking changes so you can adopt gradually.
Advanced Routing Patterns: Parallel routes, intercepting routes, and more.
The new Next.js router will be built on top of the recently released React 18 features. We plan to introduce defaults and conventions that allow you to easily adopt these new features and take advantage of the benefits they unlock.

Work on this RFC is ongoing and we'll announce when the new features are available. To provide feedback, join the conversation on Github Discussions.
